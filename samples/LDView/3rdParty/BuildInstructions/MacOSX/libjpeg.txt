Download libjpeg 8c.
Extract the archive, then rename the created jpeg-8c directory to jpeg-8c-x86.
Extract the archive again, then rename the jpeg-8c directory to jpeg-8c-x64.
Extract the archive again, then rename the jpeg-8c directory to jpeg-8c-ppc.
Go into the jpeg-8c-x86 directory, then run ./configure.
Edit the Makefile.
Add " -arch i386" (without the quotes) to the end of the CFLAGS = line.
Do the same thing to the LDFLAGS = line.
Save the Makefile, then run make.
Repeat in the jpeg-8c-x64 directory, but use "-arch x86_64".
Repeat in the jpeg-8c-ppc directory, but use "-arch ppc".
Go back into the directory above all three jpeg-8c directories and run the
following command:
libtool -o libjpegu.a jpeg-8c-ppc/.libs/libjpeg.a jpeg-8c-x86/.libs/libjpeg.a jpeg-8c-x64/.libs/libjpeg.a
Use sudo to copy libjpegu.a into /usr/local/lib/.
