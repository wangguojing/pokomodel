Extract boost, go into its directory, then run ./bootstrap.sh.
After bootstrap.sh is done, you'll have bjam, so run the following command:
./bjam --with-date_time --with-thread architecture=combined address-model=32_64 link=static variant=release stage release
Go into LDView's QT directory and run ./boost.symlink <path-to-boost> (replacing
<path-to-boost> with the path to the root directory of the boost source tree.
