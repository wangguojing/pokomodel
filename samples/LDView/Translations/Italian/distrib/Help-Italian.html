		<I>Please note</I>: this help file mostly documents the Windows version of LDView, with a few notes about the QT (Linux and Mac) version, and some specific notes on different conventions in the Mac version. For the most part, the QT version has the same functionality as the Windows version, and looks and acts the same (aside from having a mostly native UI look). However, certain features (such as FSAA support) are missing from the QT version, and other features (such as full screen support) are present with less functionality. If you are using a non-Windows version of LDView, please don't expect 100% of the features documented here to be present (although a very high percentage are present). Anywhere this document refers to the QT version of LDView, it is referring to the version made using the QT user interface library. The QT-based version of LDView is currently only available in binary form as a Linux binary and a (Universal) Mac binary. This version should work fine if compiled in other Unix-like operating systems, though (as long QT will compile on them).
<P>LDView displays LDraw models, and consequently requires that LDraw be installed. LDraw can be downloaded from <A HREF="http://www.ldraw.org/">ldraw.org</A>, along with the up-to-date parts library. If you install LDraw in any directory other than C:\LDRAW (/usr/local/ldraw in the QT version), and don't already have an LDRAWDIR environment variable, you will be asked the first time LDView loads if you already have the LDraw library installed. If you say that you do, you will be asked to select the directory in which LDraw is installed. Until you select the LDraw directory, you will be unable to load a model. If you respond that you don't already have LDraw installed, you will be asked if you want LDView to download it for you.</P>
<P>When you run LDView, it will open its main window and immediately present you with an open file dialog (assuming you didn't specify a file as part of the launch process). Select the LDraw .ldr, .dat, or .mpd file you want to view. It will then display the file in the window. Note that you can resize this window. Also note that if you open a large model, it could take a substantial amount of time to load. During this time, the status bar will indicate the progress of the load. Hitting Escape, or choosing <A HREF="#CancelLoad">Cancel Load</A> from the File menu, will cancel the load.</P>

		<P>LDView on Mac OS X uses the standard Mac convention of using the Command key instead of the Control key for common activities. Anywhere in this document that you see the Control key mentioned, remember that the Command key should be used instead.</P>
		<P>The menu layout on Mac OS X is also somewhat different. The Preferences, About LDView, and Exit menu items have been moved to their standard location in the application (LDView) menu (with Exit being renamed to the standard of Quit LDView). The recent files list has been placed in a standard Open Recent sub-menu of the File menu. And the Edit menu has been removed, since the only item normally found there in LDView is Preferences.</P>
<P>If your mouse only has one button, holding down Control while clicking is equivalent to using the right mouse button (as is standard). Additionally, if you have a laptop with a touch pad that supports two-finger dragging to scroll, this is equivalent to using the mouse wheel (also as is standard).</P>

<TABLE CLASS="SectionHeader" WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#0080D0">
<TR>
<TH ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT SIZE="+2" COLOR="#FFFFFF">LDraw Parts Library </FONT></TH>
</TR>
</TABLE>
LDView displays LDraw models, and LDraw models (almost always) make use of parts in the LDraw parts library. In order to display those models, LDView needs for the LDraw parts library to be present on your computer, and needs to know where on your computer the parts library is located. (If you only want to use LDView to view models that have been created in the LDraw file format that do not make use of the LDraw parts library, please see the documentation for the <A HREF="#VerifyLDrawSetting">VerifyLDrawDir setting</A>.)
<P>The first time you run LDView, it probably won't be able to find the LDraw parts library, even if the library is already present on your computer. If this happens, LDView will ask you if the library has already been installed. If you already have the LDraw parts library on your computer, answer Yes, and then show LDView where to find the library.</P>
<P>If you don't already have the LDraw parts library on your computer, answer No, and you will be asked if you would like LDView to download the library for you. As long as you aren't using a proxy server for HTTP connections, you can answer Yes, and you will be asked where you want the library to be put. After this, LDView will automatically download the latest version of the LDraw parts library from LDraw.org. Once the library has been downloaded and installed, you can then view models. Please note that the LDraw parts library is somewhat large (over 6MB at the time this was written), so it could take a while to download if you don't have a fast Internet connection.</P>
<P>If you use a proxy server for HTTP connections, tell LDView not to download the LDraw parts library right now, and then go to the <A HREF="#UpdatesTab">Updates tab</A> in LDView's preferences and configure your proxy server settings.</P>
<P>By default, if LDView encounters a request for a part that it cannot find, it will attempt to download the part from the LDraw.org parts tracker. The parts tracker contains all the unofficial parts that have been submitted for inclusion in the official LDraw parts library that have either not yet been approved for inclusion, or have been approved, but not yet been included in an official release of the library. Because unofficial parts can change in ways that aren't compatible with old models (for example, being rotated), LDView generates a warning any time it uses an unofficial file that it has downloaded. Note that if the part subsequently gets added to the official library, the official version will automatically be used instead (once you update your parts library), and the warning will go away.</P>

<A NAME="MouseControl"></A>
<TABLE CLASS="SectionHeader" WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#0080D0">

<TH ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT SIZE="+2" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Mouse and Keyboard Control </FONT></TH>

</TABLE>
LDView has two different modes of user interaction: <A HREF="#ExamineMode">Examine Mode</A> and <A HREF="#FlyMode">Fly-through Mode</A>. By default LDView is in Examine Mode. You can switch modes by selecting the mode you want from the <A HREF="#ViewMenu">View Menu</A>.
<P><FONT SIZE="+2"><B><A NAME="ExamineMode">Examine Mode</A></B></FONT><BR>
Click the left mouse button and drag around to rotate the model. If you let go of the button while the mouse is in motion, the model will continue to rotate on its own.</P>
<P>If you hold down the control key prior to clicking and dragging with the left mouse button, or if you click the middle mouse button and drag, you will pan the model instead of rotating it. The model will be pulled in the direction you move the mouse. If you accidentally lose the model completely, and can't find it, you can use the <A HREF="#ResetView">Reset View</A> option on the View menu to reset the view.</P>
<P>If you <A NAME="MouseLightDirection">hold down the shift key</A> prior to clicking and dragging with the left mouse button, you will change the light direction. An arrow will be drawn to indicate the current light direction, and moving the mouse will rotate the direction that the arrow points, as well as updating the light direction. If you have problems getting it back to its default setting, you can choose one of the <A HREF="#LightDirection">preset light directions</A> in the Effects tab of the preferences.</P>
<P>Click the right mouse button and move it up or down to zoom in or out. The speed at which it zooms in or out is based on how far you move the mouse from where you initially clicked. If you have a mouse with a scroll-wheel, you can also use the scroll-wheel to zoom in and out.</P>
<P>If you hold down the control key while zooming (either with the right mouse button or the scroll wheel), you will adjust the cutaway mode instead of zooming in the camera. Cutaway mode cuts away everything on the model that is closer than a certain distance. This distance is defined by a clipping plane. This allows you to look inside models without having to resort to wireframe mode. Zooming in with the control key pressed moves the clipping plane away from the camera, causing more and more of the model to be cut away. Zooming out moves the clipping plane toward the camera, causing less and less to be cut away. Please note that you will likely have to zoom in a ways before the clipping plane reaches the model, so there will probably be no imediate result. If you want, you can have LDView draw the cutaway portion of the model in wireframe, using the <A HREF="#WireframeCutaway">Wireframe cutaway</A> option. Note that this will slow things down considerably, since the entire model has to be rendered twice.</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="+2"><B><A NAME="FlyMode">Fly-through Mode</A></B></FONT><BR>
Click the left mouse button and move it around to turn the camera left, right, up, and down. The further you move the mouse from the point you clicked, the faster the camera will turn.</P>
<P>The camera can be moved using the keyboard. At any time, you can hold down shift to double the speed at which you move. The movement keys are as follows:</P>

You can switch to fullscreen mode via the View menu. To do so, select a color depth and resolution combination, and then select the <SPAN CLASS="NoWrap">View-&gt;Switch</SPAN> to Fullscreen menu option, or hit Ctrl+Enter. To exit full screen mode, either hit Ctrl+Enter again or hit Escape. Note that this feature does not work properly on all video cards. If it doesn't work on your video card, you should get an error dialog after the screen resolution is changed. After you dismiss the error dialog, it should automatically switch back to windowed mode. While in fullscreen mode you can spin the model around with the mouse, and zoom in and out the same way you did in windowed mode.

		<P>As long as your video card supports 2D Windows functionality while in fullscreen mode, the Open dialog and Preferences dialog can be accessed from fullscreen mode via their keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+O for Open File; Ctrl+Shift+P for Preferences). If you are unsure, try Ctrl+O first, and if you don't see an Open dialog, hit escape to dismiss the Open dialog that you can't see. F5 for reload also works--whether or not your video card supports 2D Windows funtionality from fullscreen mode--but unless you are displaying a file that someone else on your network is modifying, it's not likely to be very useful.</P>

<TH ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT SIZE="+2" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Save Snapshot Options </FONT></TH>
</TR>
</TABLE>
When you save a snapshot, the following LDView-specific options show up at the bottom of the standard save dialog box.
<P><I>Save snapshot series</I> (Default: <I>Off</I>):<BR>
Enabling this option causes a unique number to automatically be appended to the filename. This allows you to save a number of shots of the same model without having to enter a new filename each time.</P>
<P><I>Number of Digits</I> (Default: <I>1</I>):<BR>
This option is only available when save snapshot series is enabled. It controls the number of digits in the number that is appended to the filename. Zeroes are added before the number to make up the number of digits you select here. For example, if you select 3 here, and the number is 5, then 005 will be used in the filename instead of just 5.</P>
<P><I>Don't use Pixel Buffer</I> (Default: <I>Off</I>):<BR>
Enabling this option disables the use of a pixel buffer for snapshot rendering. Use of a pixel buffer can result in a corrupt image on certain video cards with certain video drivers. If your snapshots are corrupted, enable this. Otherwise, leave it disabled.</P>
<P><I>Save image with specific size</I> (Default: <I>Off</I>):<BR>
Enabling this option allows you to specify a width and height for the snapshot image. Otherwise, the snapshot created will have the same dimensions as the LDView window.</P>
<P><I>Width</I> (Default: <I>1024</I>):<BR>
This option is only available when save image with specific size is enabled. It sets the width (in pixels) of the resulting snapshot image.</P>
<P>Note that if this is bigger than a certain threshold (which differs from one video card to another), a number of tiles will be rendered and stitched together automatically to form the full image. This may cause the actual image width to be slightly less than the requested width due to rounding.</P>
<P><I>Height</I> (Default: <I>768</I>):<BR>
This option is only available when save image with specific size is enabled. It sets the height (in pixels) of the resulting snapshot image.</P>
<P>Note that if this is bigger than a certain threshold (which differs from one video card to another), a number of tiles will be rendered and stitched together automatically to form the full image. This may cause the actual image width to be slightly less than the requested width due to rounding.</P>
<P><I>Zoom to Fit</I> (Default: <I>Off</I>):<BR>
This option is only available when save image with specific size is enabled. Enabling it causes the model to be zoomed to fill up the snapshot, as much as possible. (Most models will only fill the image in either the vertical direction or the horizontal direction, but not both.) Note that the viewing angle is left the same, but the model may be panned so that it fits best.</P>
		<P>The reason this requires the <I>Save image with specific size</I> check box to be checked is that when you save with a different aspect ratio, it can effect the cropping of the model. When creating a snapshot the same size as the LDView window, you can position the model exactly like you want manually, and are free to use <I>Zoom to Fit</I> on the View menu prior to taking your snapshot to produce the same result.</P>

<TR>
<TH ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT SIZE="+2" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Errors &amp; Warnings Window </FONT></TH>
</TR>
</TABLE>
The Errors &amp; Warnings window displays errors and warnings that were encountered while loading an LDraw model.
<P>On the left-hand side is a tree view which displays all of the errors. By default, there is one collapsed entry per error, with a brief description of the error. Clicking on the plus sign to the left of the error shows you more information about that error. The first piece of information is the file that contained the error. If you double-click on this, it will open the file using Notepad. Following that are the line # that contained the error, and the line of text itself. Neither of these has any actions associated with it. Certain errors may contain further information as well.</P>
<P>Below the tree view is the <I>Include Warnings</I> check box. Checking this will cause LDView to show both errors and warnings. Unchecking it will hide all the warnings. Please note that warnings don't mean there is anything wrong with the file, so warnings are hidden by default.</P>
<P>Beside the <I>Include Warnings</I> check box is the <I>Copy Error to Clipboard</I> button. Clicking this will cause all the text from the currently selected error to copied into the clipboard, so that it can be pasted into another application.</P>
<P>On the right-hand side of the window is a list view containing a set of check boxes that determine what types of errors should be shown. By default, all types of errors are shown. You can disable any errors you don't care about. Following are the error types:</P>
<P><I>General error</I><BR>
You probably won't ever see an error of this type. It is used for rare situations that shouldn't ever happen. (For example, if you delete the LDraw directory while a model is loading, you might get one of these.)</P>
<P><I>Parse error</I><BR>
A line in the model file was invalid.</P>
<P><I>File not found</I><BR>
The model referenced another model which could not be found in any of the standard search locations (the current directory; the LDraw model, parts, and p directories; entries in the <A HREF="#ExtraDirs">extra search directories</A> list).</P>
<P><I>Singular matrix</I><BR>
The model contains a reference to another model with one of the three dimensions scaled to zero. This is generally considered bad form, but is often done when referencing another file that happens to be two-dimensional.</P>
<P><I>Part transformed non-uniformly</I><BR>
The model contains a part which has been distorted in some way. While parts are rotated and moved around to make up a model, they should seldom if ever be stretched or skewed. This usually indicates that the model referencing the part has a problem.</P>
<P><I>Non-flat quad</I><BR>
The model contains a quadrilateral (quad) that isn't flat. There are two perfectly valid ways to split a quad into two triangles, and they result in different geometry when the quad isn't flat. Consequently, non-flat quads are considered to be errors. Note that there is a reasonable amount of leeway in LDView's definition of &quot;flat&quot;, so rounding in the file shouldn't trigger this error.</P>
<P><I>Concave quad</I><BR>
The model contains a concave quadrilateral. Concave means that one of the four points is inside the triangle formed by the other three points. While not technically an error, this is considered bad form, and may produce incorrect results in other LDraw-compatible renderering programs.</P>
<P><I>Bad vertex sequence</I><BR>
The model contains a quadrilateral whose points are specified in &quot;bow-tie&quot; order. In other words, if you visit the points in the order given, you'll end up with two triangles that meet at a point. Two of the vertices must be swapped in order to create the quad that was desired. Once again, this isn't techically an error (unless it is in a BFC-certified portion of a file), but is considered bad form, and may produce incorrect results in other LDraw-compatible rendering programs.</P>
<P><I>Co-linear points</I><BR>
The model contains a quad or a triangle that has three or four co-linear points. When this is detected in a quad, the quad is turned into a triangle (or a line if all four points are co-linear). When it is detected in a triangle (all three points are co-linear), the triangle is turned into a line. Note that some people might think that using co-linear points in a quad is a valid way to get rid of T-junctions (a computer graphic term whose explanation isn't important here). However, since there are two legitimate ways to split a quad into two triangles, and one of those ways results in a triangle and a line (instead of two triangles), this is <B>not</B> a legitimate way to avoid T-junctions.</P>
<P><I>BFC warning</I><BR>
The model contains back-face culling (BFC) information that seems unusual (but is still valid).</P>
<P><I>BFC error</I><BR>
The model contains back-face culling (BFC) information that is invalid.</P>
<P><I>MPD error</I><BR>
The model contains multi-part DAT (MPD) information that is invalid.</P>
<P><I>Whitespace</I><BR>
The model references a sub-model whose filename contains whitespace (spaces and/or tabs). While this will work in some programs (including LDView), it won't work in others, and is discouraged.</P>
<P><I>Part renamed</I><BR>
The model references a part that has been renamed to a new number (otherwise known as &quot;moved to&quot;).</P>
<P><I>Unofficial part used</I><BR>
The model references a part that isn't present in the main LDraw directory, but was found by LDView on the LDraw.org Parts Tracker and automatically downloaded.</P>
<P><I>Model loop</I><BR>
One of the model's sub-models (or parts) contains a reference to one of its ancestors. For example, if you load Test1.ldr, and it has Test2.ldr as a sub-model, and Test2.ldr has Test1.ldr as one of <B>its</B> sub-models, you will get this error. Similarly, if Test2.ldr has Test3.ldr as a sub-model, and Test3.ldr has Test1.ldr as a sub-model, you will also get this error.</P>
<P>If <A HREF="#ShowErrors">Show errors after loading</A> is checked in the preferences dialog, the Errors &amp; Warnings window will automatically be displayed when a model is loaded that contains errors that are set to be shown. It will not be shown if the only errors in the model have been unchecked in the Errors &amp; Warnings window, the model only contains warnings, or the Errors &amp; Warnings window isn't set to show automatically.</P>

<I><A NAME="FSAA">FSAA</A></I> (Default: <I>None</I>):<BR>
This allows you to select what level of full-scene antialiasing to use. Note that if your video card does not support full-scene antialiasing, then <I>None</I> will be the only available item. If your video card does support full-scene antialiasing, then all available FSAA modes should be available to choose from.<BR>
If you have an nVIDIA&reg; video card with Quincunx support, then 2x Enhanced and 4x Enhanced should show up as options. These use nVIDIA's advanced FSAA filter.</P>
<P><I>Antialiased lines</I> (Default: <I>Off</I>):<BR>
Enabling this option causes lines to be drawn using antialiasing. This does not effect wireframe mode. Line antialiasing can significantly improve the visual quality of lines, but it can also significantly impact the frame rate. This option may not have an effect if <A HREF="#FSAA">Full-scene Antialiasing</A> is enabled.</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><A NAME="GeneralColorsBox">Colors Box</A></B></FONT><BR>
<I>Background</I> (Default: <I>Black</I>):<BR>
This allows you to set the color used to draw the background behind the model.</P>
<P><I>Default</I> (Default: <I>Black</I>):<BR>
This allows you to set the default color. Normally this is only visible when you load a part directly. Most models don't ever use this color.<BR>
Note that edge lines on default-colored objects will be black unless you choose the exact RGB value used by one of the standard LDraw colors. The default custom colors in the color dialog correspond to the first 16 standard LDraw colors. Resetting the General preferences also resets these colors.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><A NAME="GeneralMiscBox">Misc Box</A></B></FONT><BR>
<I>Process ldconfig.ldr</I> (Default: <I>On</I>):<BR>
This controls whether or not LDView processes the ldconfig.ldr file that is now distributed as part of the LDraw parts library. This file contains settings that can effect how LDraw models are displayed. Currently the only settings it contains are color definitions. Enabling this option will use the LDraw.org standard color definitions; disabling it will use LDView's default color definitions.</P>
<P><I>Show frame rate</I> (Default: <I>Off</I>):<BR>
Enabling this option causes the frame rate to show up in the lower left-hand corner of the window. A number is only displayed while the model is in constant motion. The easiest way to do this is to spin it (see <A HREF="#MouseControl">mouse control</A>).</P>
<P><A NAME="ShowErrors"><I>Show errors after loading</I></A> (Default: <I>On</I>):<BR>
Enabling this option causes the <A HREF="#ErrorWindow">Errors &amp; Warnings window</A> to automatically be displayed after loading a model that contains any errors that have been selected for display in the Errors &amp; Warnings window.</P>
<I>Fullscreen refresh override</I> (Default: <I>Off</I>):<BR>
		
When checked, this setting allows you to override the default refresh rate used in fullscreen mode. Enter a number in the field for the desired refresh rate. Please note that if the refresh rate you enter is not supported another refresh rate will be used.

Enter a number in this field to control the field of view (in degrees). Setting this to the minimum value of 0.1 will produce an image that is essentially orthographic. Setting it to the maximum value of 90 will produce a wide-angle view.</P>
<P><I>Memory Usage</I> (Default: <I>High</I>):<BR>
This allows you to have some control over how much memory LDView uses. Normally, setting this to High will result in the best performance. However, if you load a large model that uses more memory than you have available, setting this to Medium or Low may improve performance.<BR>
Please note that while the High setting usually results in noticeably faster performance than the Medium setting, it usually consumes only marginally more memory. The Low setting should produce a much more considerable memory savings. Note also that if you use LDView to perform command line rendering, or use it as the renderer in LPub (which is actually command line rendering), the Low setting will likely be at least as fast as the other settings, and will very likely actually result in faster performance.</P>

<A NAME="SeamWidth"><I>Seam width</I></A> (Default: <I>On/0.50</I>):<BR>
Enabling this option allows you to set the width of the seams between pieces using the up and down arrows to the right. This setting produces the same effect as the Seam Width option of <A HREF="http://home16.inet.tele.dk/hassing/l3p.html">L3P</A>. The field then displays the current seam width.

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><A NAME="GeometryWireframeBox">Wireframe Box</A></B></FONT><BR>
<I>Wireframe</I> (Default: <I>Off</I>):<BR>
Enabling this option causes the model to be drawn in wireframe. Note that with many 3D accelerators, this actually runs slower than when drawing as a solid.</P>
<P><I>Fog</I> (Default: <I>Off</I>):<BR>
This option is only enabled if wireframe drawing is enabled. Enabling it causes fog to be used to make it so that the lines that are farther away are drawn more dimly.</P>
<P><I>Remove hidden lines</I> (Default: <I>Off</I>):<BR>
This option is only available if wireframe drawing is enabled. Enabling it causes the solid (non-transparent) portions of the model to hide lines that are behind them, even though these portions themselves aren't actually drawn.</P>
<P><I>Thickness</I> (Default: <I>0%</I>):<BR>
This option is only available if wireframe drawing is enabled. It adjusts the thickness of the lines used to draw the model in wireframe mode.</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><A NAME="GeometryBFCBox">BFC Box</A></B></FONT><BR>
<I>BFC</I> (Default: <I>On</I>):<BR>
Enabling this option turns on back-face culling (BFC). BFC is a technique that can improve rendering performance by not drawing the back faces of polygons. (Only BFC-certified parts have their back faces removed.)<BR>
Note that while this can improve rendering performance, it can also slow things down, so don't assume that enabling this will always result in the best performance.</P>
<P><I>Red back faces</I> (Default: <I>Off</I>):<BR>
This option is only available while BFC is enabled. Enabling it causes the back faces of polygons to be drawn in red. This is mainly useful for part authors to allow them to correctly specify which direction faces should face in order to BFC certify their part files.</P>
<P><I>Green front faces</I> (Default: <I>Off</I>):<BR>
This option is only available while BFC is enabled. Enabling it causes the front faces of polygons to be drawn in green. This is mainly useful for part authors to allow them to correctly specify which direction faces should face in order to BFC certify their part files.</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><A NAME="GeometryEdgeLinesBox">Edge Lines Box</A></B></FONT><BR>
<A NAME="DrawEdges"><I>Edge Lines</I></A> (Default: <I>Off</I>):<BR>
Enabling this option causes the edge lines that outline all the pieces to be drawn.</P>
<P><I>Show edges only</I> (Default: <I>Off</I>):<BR>
This option is only available if edge lines are enabled. Enabling it causes LDView to only show edge lines. Unless you also select the Wireframe option, the portions of the edge lines that are hidden by the model will still be hidden, even thought the model isn't being shown.</P>
<P><I>Conditional lines</I> (Default: <I>Off</I>):<BR>
This option is only available if edge lines are enabled. Enabling it causes conditional edge lines to be computed and drawn. Conditional edge lines show up as a silhouette of curved surfaces; they are only drawn when they are visually at the edge of the surface from the current viewing angle.</P>

</TABLE>
<P><I>High quality</I> (Default: <I>On</I>):<BR>
This option is only available if edge lines are enabled. Enabling it causes edge lines to be drawn slightly closer to the eye than everything else, resulting in much better looking lines.</P>
<P><I>Always black</I> (Default: <I>Off</I>):<BR>
This option is only available if edge lines are enabled. Enabling it causes all edge lines to be drawn in black. This can be useful to part authors, as it causes the edge lines in the default color (light gray) to be much more visible.</P>
<P><I>Thickness</I> (Default: <I>0%</I>):<BR>
This option is only available if edge lines are enabled. It adjusts the thickness of the lines used to draw the edges around the pieces.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><A NAME="EffectsLightingBox">Lighting Box</A></B></FONT><BR>
<I>Lighting</I> (Default: <I>On</I>):<BR>
Enabling this option enables lighting. If you disable lighting, it is strongly recommended that you enable <A HREF="#DrawEdges">edge lines</A>, unless you are in <A HREF="#GeometryWireframeBox">wireframe</A> mode.</P>
<P><A NAME="QualityLighting"><I>High quality</I></A> (Default: <I>Off</I>):<BR>
This option is only available if lighting is enabled. Selecting this enables high quality lighting. The easiest way to see the difference between having this option on and off is with a baseplate. If you angle a baseplate until the <A HREF="#Specular">specular highlight</A> becomes visible (it gets shiny), and then switch back and forth, you will see that the highlight is located in a specific location when high quality lighting is enabled, and covers the entire surface when it is disabled. Enabling this can significantly decrease performance, especially with large models.</P>
<P><I>Subdued</I> (Default: <I>Off</I>):<BR>
This option is only available if lighting is enabled. Selecting this sets the lighting to a subdued level. Subdued lighting is about halfway in between standard lighting and no lighting at all. This can produce nice results when <A HREF="#DrawEdges">edge lines</A> are enabled.</P>
<P><A NAME="Specular"><I>Specular highlight</I></A> (Default: <I>On</I>):<BR>
This option is only available if lighting is enabled. Selecting this turns on the specular highlight. This causes the model to appear shiny.</P>
<P><A NAME="AlternateLighting"><I>Alternate setup</I></A> (Default: <I>Off</I>):<BR>
This option is only available if lighting is enabled. Selecting this causes LDView to use an alternate lighting setup, which may improve performance on some video cards, but will more likely decrease performance. The alternate setup is used automatically when <A HREF="#Specular">specular highlight</A> is enabled, whether or not this option is enabled, since specular highlight only works properly with the alternate setup.</P>
<P><A NAME="LightDirection"><I>Light direction</I></A><BR>
Set the direction the light comes from to a pre-set angle.<BR>
Please note: If you <A HREF="#MouseLightDirection">change the light direction with the mouse</A>, it is almost certain that none of the pre-set light direction buttons will be highlighted.</P>
<P><I>Upper left</I> (Default?: <I>No</I>):<BR>
Set the light direction to come from the upper left.</P>
<P><I>Above</I> (Default?: <I>No</I>):<BR>
Set the light direction to come from above.</P>
<P><I>Upper right</I> (Default?: <I>No</I>):<BR>
Set the light direction to come from the upper right.</P>
<P><I>Left</I> (Default?: <I>No</I>):<BR>
Set the light direction to come from the left.</P>
<P><I>Middle</I> (Default?: <I>Yes</I>):<BR>
Set the light direction to come from the middle (always pointing in exactly the same direction the camera is pointing).</P>
<P><I>Right</I> (Default?: <I>No</I>):<BR>
Set the light direction to come from the right.</P>
<P><I>Lower left</I> (Default?: <I>No</I>):<BR>

<P><I>Below</I> (Default?: <I>No</I>):<BR>
Set the light direction to come from below.</P>
<P><I>Lower right</I> (Default?: <I>No</I>):<BR>
Set the light direction to come from the lower right.</P>
<P><A><I>Use LIGHT.DAT lights</I></A> (Default: <I>On</I>):<BR>
This option is only available if lighting is enabled. Selecting this causes LDView to put point light sources in the scene in the locations where LIGHT.DAT is used as a part. LDView uses the color assigned to the light part as the color for the light source. Note that at most 8 lights will be shown by LDView (the first 8 in the file), and if the video card doesn't support 8, then less will be shown.</P>
<P><A><I>Replace standard light</I></A> (Default: <I>On</I>):<BR>
This option is only available if lighting is enabled and Use LIGHT.DAT lights is checked. Selecting this causes LDView to not use its standard light source any time a model is loaded that contains one or more LIGHT.DAT parts. Models that don't contain any LIGHT.DAT parts will still be illuminated using LDView's standard light source. Note that using both LIGHT.DAT lights and the standard light source will often result in too much light, leading to a kind of overexposure effect.</P>
<P><A><I>Hide LIGHT.DAT geometry</I></A> (Default: <I>Off</I>):<BR>
Selecting this causes LDView to not display the geometry from LIGHT.DAT parts. Since the geometry is a small set of 3D coordinate axes, you often don't want to see it.</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><A NAME="EffectsStereoBox">Stereo Box</A></B></FONT><BR>
<I>Stereo</I> (Default: <I>Off</I>):<BR>
Enabling this option turns on stereo mode. Stereo mode draws two images: a slightly different one for each eye.</P>
<P><I>Cross-eyed</I> (Default?: <I>No</I>):<BR>
This option is only available if stereo is enabled. Selecting this sets the stereo mode to cross-eyed stereo. The two images are drawn side by side, with the image for the right eye on the left and the image for the left eye on the right. By crossing your eyes and then focusing, you can see a stereoscopic image. Many people find it difficult or even impossible to focus with their eyes crossed.</P>
<P><I>Parallel</I> (Default?: <I>No</I>):<BR>
This option is only available if stereo is enabled. Selecting this sets the stereo mode to parallel stereo. The two images are drawn side by side, with the image for the right eye on the right and the image for the left eye on the left. By looking in the distance and then focusing, you can see a stereoscopic image. This will only work if the distance between the two images is no greater than the distance between your eyes, so the window will need to be kept fairly narrow. Many people find it difficult or even impossible to look at an image in this way and then focus.</P>
<P><I>Amt</I> (Default: <I>50%</I>):<BR>
This option is only available if stereo is enabled. The slider controls the stereo spacing. A small value will result in a very subtle stereoscopic effect, as if you were looking at a very large object from a very long distance. (The minimum value results in no stereoscopic effect at all.) A large value will result in a pronounced stereoscopic effect, as if you were looking at a small object from a very short distance.</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><A NAME="EffectsCutawayBox">Wireframe Cutaway Box</A></B></FONT><BR>
<A NAME="WireframeCutaway"><I>Wireframe cutaway</I></A> (Default: <I>Off</I>):<BR>
Enabling this option causes the cutaway portion of the model to be drawn in wireframe. Hold down the Control key and click and drag up with the right mouse button to increase the amount of the model that is cut away. Control right drag down to decrease the cutaway amount.</P>
<P><I>Color</I> (Default?: <I>No</I>):<BR>
This option is only available if wireframe cutaway is enabled. Selecting it causes the wireframe cutaway to be drawn in color.</P>
<P><I>Monochrome</I> (Default?: <I>No</I>):<BR>
This option is only available if wireframe cutaway is enabled. Selecting it causes the wireframe cutaway to be drawn in monochrome. This isn't available on all graphics cards.</P>
<P><I>Opacity</I> (Default: <I>100%</I>):<BR>
This option is only available if wireframe cutaway is enabled. The slider controls the opacity of the wireframe cutaway. When Color is selected as the type of wireframe cutaway to draw this may be fixed at 100% on some graphics cards. Also, when color is selected and sort is not selected in the transparency box, transparent pieces will ignore the opacity setting and be drawn with the standard opacity for transparent pieces.</P>
<P><I>Thickness</I> (Default: <I>0%</I>):<BR>
This option is only available if wireframe cutaway is enabled. The slider controls the thickness of the lines in the wireframe cutaway.</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><A NAME="EffectsTransparencyBox">Transparency Box</A></B></FONT><BR>
<I>Sort transparent polygons</I> (Default: <I>On</I>):<BR>
Enabling this option causes transparent shapes to be drawn in back-to-front order in order to produce a correct result. If they aren't sorted, distant transparent shapes can end up being drawn as if they were in front of less distant transparent shapes. Unfortunately, this can cause a significant slowdown in some models. This option is mutually exclusive with the use stipple pattern option.</P>
<P><I>Use stipple pattern</I> (Default: <I>Off</I>):<BR>
Enabling this option causes transparent shapes to be drawn using a stipple (checkerboard) pattern. This may be significantly faster on some video hardware, but with potentially reduced quality. Using the stipple pattern totally eliminates the errors that may occur where far transparent objects are drawn in front of closer ones. This option is mutually exclusive with the sort transparent polygons option.</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><A NAME="EffectsMiscBox">Misc Box</A></B></FONT><BR>
<I>Flat shading</I> (Default: <I>Off</I>):<BR>
Enabling this option causes flat shading to be used. Note that while flat shading is less complicated to draw, with a modern 3D accelerator this will not likely improve the performance at all. Flat shading will only likely provide a visual difference if you have either <A HREF="#QualityLighting">high quality lighting</A> or <A HREF="#PrimitiveSubstitution">primitive substitution</A> enabled, in which case turning on flat shading can produce odd results. This option is mutually exclusive with the smooth curves option.</P>
<P><I>Smooth curves</I> (Default: <I>On</I>):<BR>
Enabling this option causes curved surfaces to be shaded as curved surfaces instead of as facets. Since this relies on information in the LDraw model file that was originally designed for a different purpose, not all curved surfaces will be effected. This option is mutually exclusive with the flat shading option.</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="+2"><B><A NAME="PrimitivesTab">Primitives Tab</A></B></FONT><BR>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><A NAME="PrimitivesSubstitutionBox">Primitive Substitution Box</A></B></FONT><BR>
<A NAME="PrimitiveSubstitution"><I>Primitive substitution</I></A> (Default: <I>On</I>):<BR>
Enabling this option causes LDView to use its own optimized version of many of the primitives (such as cylinders, cones, etc). As well as providing enhanced performance, this also provides improved visual quality, since smooth shaded primitives are generated where appropriate.</P>
<P><I>Texture studs</I> (Default: <I>On</I>):<BR>
This option is only available if primitive substitution is enabled. Enabling it causes a LEGO&reg; logo to be textured onto all the standard studs.</P>
<P><I>Nearest filtering</I> (Default?: <I>No</I>):<BR>
This option is only available if primitive substitution and texture studs are both enabled. Selecting it causes nearest texel texture filtering to be used. This is the lowest quality texture filtering.</P>
<P><I>Bilinear filtering</I> (Default?: <I>No</I>):<BR>
This option is only available if primitive substitution and texture studs are both enabled. Selecting it causes bilinear texture filtering to be used. This is the middle quality texture filtering.</P>
<P><I>Trilinear filtering</I> (Default?: <I>Yes</I>):<BR>
This option is only available if primitive substitution and texture studs are both enabled. Selecting it causes trilinear texture filtering to be used. This is the highest quality texture filtering.</P>
<P><I>Anisotropic filtering</I> (Default?: <I>No</I>):<BR>
This option is only available if primitive substitution and texture studs are both enabled, and your video card supports it. Selecting it causes anisotropic texture filtering to be used. When anisotropic filtering is selected, you can pick the filtering level on the slider to the right of the radio button. This is the highest quality texture filtering.</P>
<P><I>Anisotropic filtering level</I> (Default: <I>Off</I>):<BR>
This option is only available if primitive substitution and texture studs are both enabled, and anisotropic filtering is selected as the filtering type. It adjusts the anisotropic filtering level. Higher numbers produce higher quality filtering.</P>
<P><I>Curve quality</I> (Default: <I>9%</I>):<BR>
This option is only available if primitive substitution is enabled. It adjusts the quality of substituted primitives by changing the number of facets used to draw curved primitives. Changing this from its default value can lead to holes in the model between the substitute primitives and other geometry. Be very careful with this setting. Setting it too high can lead to huge slow-downs. The default setting of 2 (9%) is fine for most models.</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><A NAME="PrimitivesMiscBox">Misc Box</A></B></FONT><BR>
<I>Low quality studs (faster)</I> (Default: <I>On</I>):<BR>
Enabling this option switches to using the low-resolution stud files instead of the normal-resolution stud files. This can produce significantly faster rendering.</P>
<P><I>Use hi-res primitives when available</I> (Default: <I>Off</I>):<BR>
Enabling this option causes LDView to attempt to load hi-res versions of primitives before loading the standard ones. The hi-res primitives are otherwise known as 48-sided primitives, because they approximate circular features with 48-sided features. Since not all primitives have hi-res versions, enabling this can create gaps between the standard resolution primitives and the hi-res ones.</P>

</TABLE>
LDView allows you to do a few things from the command line. LDView must either be in your path, in the current directory, or have its complete path specified on the command line in order to run (just like any other program run from the command line). If you are unfamiliar with running programs from the command line, I would strongly suggest skipping this section. Even if you are familiar with running programs from the command line, please note that since LDView is a normal Windows program, and not a console program, the command prompt may behave as though LDView has exited immediately after it launches. It won't necessarily wait for LDView to exit before giving you another prompt.
<P><FONT SIZE="+2"><B><A NAME="CommandLineFilename">Specifying a Filename</A></B></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>You can specify a filename on the command line, and LDView will open that file (if it exists) instead of presenting you with the initial Open dialog. You must either specify the complete pathname of the file, including the extension (e.g. .ldr, .dat, .mpd), or be in the directory that contains the file when you run LDView. Note that if your filename contains spaces, the entire filename must be enclosed in double quotes. (This is standard for any Windows command line with long filenames.)</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="+2"><B><A NAME="SnapshotFilename">Specifying a Snapshot Filename</A></B></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>You can use the -SaveSnapshot command line option to have LDView take a snapshot of your model and output it to the specified filename automatically. After creating the snapshot, LDView will immediately exit. Note that this only works if you also <A HREF="#CommandLineFilename">specify a filename</A> for model you want to take a snapshot of. For example:</P>

<PRE>
	LDView MyModel.ldr -SaveSnapshot=MyModel.png
</PRE>
<P>The image filename must have either .png or .bmp as its extension, and the appropriate image type will be created accordingly. Remember that control may return to the command prompt before LDView has finished executing. So if your video card allows this to run without displaying a window, you won't have a good way of knowing when LDView has finished executing.</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="+2"><B><A NAME="L3PCompatibility">L3P-compatible Options</A></B></FONT><BR>

<P>To make things easier for L3P users, LDView supports the -cg and -ca options from L3P. Unlike normal LDView settings (described <A HREF="#CommandLinePrefs">below</A>, -cg and -ca don't have any equal sign after the option name.</P>

<TD>Camera Angle:<BR>
This sets the horizontal camera angle to the value specified by &lt;a&gt;. Note that this is different from the FOV setting (-FOV=&lt;a&gt;). The FOV setting sets either the vertical or horizontal camera angle depending on the shape of the image. If the image is wider than it is tall, it sets the vertical camera angle, while if the image is taller than it is wide, it sets the horizontal camera angle. This -ca setting always sets the horizontal camera angle, no matter what shape the image is.</TD>

This places the camera on an imaginary globe at latitude &lt;la&gt; and longitude &lt;lo&gt;, pointing at the model.

</P>
<P>All of the options available in the Preferences dialog can be set from the command line, if so desired. These are all preceded with a - in order to indicate that an option is being specified. Command line settings override settings in the Preferences dialog. They may be saved as a persistent preference if you modify them or other preferences via the Preferences dialog. Otherwise, the old values will be used the next time you run the program without specifying a value for those options on the command line. Preferences are set on the command line in the following manner:</P>
<PRE>
	LDView -&lt;setting 1&gt;=&lt;value 1&gt; -&lt;setting 2&gt;=&lt;value 2&gt; ...
</PRE>
For example, to set the default window size to be 640x480, you would do the following:
<PRE>
	LDView -WindowWidth=640 -WindowHeight=480

Note that while all but the first option request FSAA to be used, it will only be used on graphics hardware that supports FSAA in addition to supporting the OpenGL extension that allows it to be set from a program other than the driver control panel.<BR>
Any standard FSAA mode can be requested by taking the desired FSAA level and multiplying by 8. For example, 6x FSAA on ATI cards can be requested by setting Antialias to 48. If you request a mode that isn't supported by your video card, you end up with no antialiasing.</TD>

<TD><A NAME="ZoomMax"></A>Advanced users can adjust the maximum zoom level. This isn't something that is generally useful except to LDraw part authors. Currently it can only be done by using the <A HREF="#ZoomMaxSetting">-ZoomMax</A> command line option, or creating or modifying the following DWORD registry key:
<P><TT>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Travis Cobbs\LDView\ZoomMax</TT></P>
<P>The default behavior can be achieved by setting it to 199 (decimal). Increasing the value above this allows you to zoom in further. Doing this results in the view position moving inside the model. Decreasing the value below 199 limits the amount you can zoom in. Setting it to values less than 100 may produce odd results, and setting it to zero will cause a division by zero which may produce a crash, or possibly a corrupted display.</P>
<P>Setting it to values significantly larger than 199 may produce odd results as well. Anything between 199 and 1000 should be fine, other than the fact that when the view position moves inside the model you get a cutaway effect.</P>
<P>Please note: this setting is not designed to position the camera when using the command line to launch LDView and take a snapshot. It only effects the maximum interactive zoom level, so increasing it will not move the initial camera view closer to the model. Decreasing it below a certain threshold will move the camera away, but this is a side effect of the fact that it won't allow you to be closer than what you set it to. If you want to change the default zoom level of the camera, use the <A HREF="#DefaultZoomSetting">DefaultZoom</A> setting.</P>

<TD><A NAME="DefaultMatrix"></A>If you want LDView to render an image from a specific angle from the command line, you can use the <A HREF="#DefaultMatrixSetting">-DefaultMatrix</A> command line option. (For an alternative way to do this, see the <A HREF="#DefaultLatLongSetting">-DefaultLatLong</A> setting.) The -DefaultMatrix setting is used to directly specify the rotation matrix applied to the model, which looks like this:

<P>Note that this is the upper left 3x3 matrix of a standard 4x4 3D transformation matrix. It is specified on the command line like the following:</P>
<P><TT>-DefaultMatrix=A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I</TT></P>
<P>For example, to get a front view of your model, use the identity matrix, like so:</P>
<P><TT>-DefaultMatrix=1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1</TT></P>
<P>If you want to decide on a viewing angle in LDView and then determine the matrix for it that can be used above, use the <A HREF="#ShowViewInfo">View-&gt;Show view info</A> menu item.</P>
<P>Note that if you use this to specify a default rotation matrix, the <I>Reset View</I> command will reset the view back to your setting until you use the <A HREF="#SaveDefaultView"><I>Save Current as Default</I></A> command to change the default viewing angle to something else.</P>

<TD><A NAME="DefaultLatLong"></A>Another way to have LDView render an image from a specific angle from the command line is to use the <A HREF="#DefaultLatLongSetting">-DefaultLatLong</A> command line option. (For an alternative way to do this, see the <A HREF="#DefaultMatrixSetting">-DefaultMatrix</A> setting.) The -DefaultLatLong setting is a (mostly) user-friendly way of specifying the viewing angle. It is very similar to the -cg option in Lars C. Hassing's L3P program. (Note that -cg is also <A HREF="#CameraGlobe">supported</A> by LDView.) -DefaultLatLong specifies the latitude and longitude of the camera on a virtual globe around the model. It is specified like so:
<P><TT>-DefaultLatLong=latitude,longitude</TT></P>
<P>You can produce LDView's standard two-thirds viewing angle by using the following setting:</P>
<P><TT>-DefaultLatLong=30,45</TT></P>
<P>Note that the optional radius parameter of the -cg option isn't supported by -DefaultLatLong. However, you can use the <A HREF="#DefaultZoomSetting">-DefaultZoom</A> setting to move the camera closer to or farther from the model. If you want to put the camera at a fixed difference, use the <A HREF="#CameraGlobe">-cg</A> option.</P>

</TABLE>
When you use the Windows Installer to install LDView, you are presented with an option near the end to install it as a screen saver. If you select this option, you can use LDView as a screen saver. Simply select it from the list of available screen savers, and then configure it as desired. When using LDView as a screen saver, you can set most of the settings that are available in standard LDView, and you can additionally set screen saver-specific settings. At the moment, Screen Saver mode is only supported in Windows.

		<P>If you don't use the install program to install LDView, or you don't check the option to install it as a screen saver and later change your mind, you can manually install it as a screen saver. Simply copy LDView.exe into your Windows System directory, and then rename the file to LDView.scr. In Windows 95/98/Me, the Windows System directory is usually <TT>C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM</TT>. In Windows NT/2000, it is usually <TT>C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32</TT>. In Windows XP, it is usually <TT>C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32</TT>. It is important that you use the <TT>SYSTEM</TT> directory in Win95/98/Me and the <TT>SYSTEM32</TT> directory otherwise. If you are unsure where to put it, I strongly recommend that you run the LDView install program, and make sure to check the option to have the screen saver module installed. You can re-install LDView over itself without any problems, so you don't have to uninstall first.</P>
