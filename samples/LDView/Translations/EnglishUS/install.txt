In order to use this language DLL, you need to copy LDView-EnglishUS.dll and
Help.html into the directory on your computer where you installed LDView.

If your computer's language isn't set to English (United States), you can use
LDView-EnglishUS.reg to force LDView to use LDView-EnglishUS.dll as its language
DLL.  Simply double click on LDView-EnglishUS.reg, and answer Yes when asked if
you want to add the information from LDView-EnglishUS.reg to the registry.  If
you later want to reset LDView so that it will use the default language, just
double click on LDView-DefaultLanguage.reg.
