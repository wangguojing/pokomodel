0 Primitive with a singular matrix (fixable):
1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 4-4disc.dat
0 Same primitive with a different singular matrix (not fixable, because the
0 matrix is singular in a dimension other than Y):
1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 4-4disc.dat
0 Part with a singular matrix (not fixable, because part isn't flat in Y):
1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 101.dat
