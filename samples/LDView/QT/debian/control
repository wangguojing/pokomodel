Description: Real-time 3D viewer for displaying LDraw models
 LDView is a real-time 3D viewer for displaying LDraw models using
 hardware-accelerated 3D graphics. LDView is capable of reading LDraw DAT,
 LDR and MPD files as well as parse subassemblies for the latter,
 using the multipart tools menu. You can view and rotate the model around
 to any angle using the mouse or keyboard. LDView was written using OpenGL:
 it should provide accelerated rendering on any video card capable of
 full OpenGL 3D acceleration (so-called 'mini-drivers' are not likely to work).
 It should also work on other video cards using OpenGL software rendering,
 albeit at a much slower speed. A  fast computer or a dedicated video card
 with T&L support (Transform & Lighting) is strongly recommended
 for displaying complex models. For information on LDraw,
 please visit www.ldraw.org, the centralized LDraw resources site.
